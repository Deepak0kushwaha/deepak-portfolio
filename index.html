        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-grid">
          <p>
            I’m an AI/ML Engineer specializing in integrating advanced machine learning into the core of mechanical engineering 
            workflows to reduce simulation time, improve design optimization, and enable physics-informed decision-making. My work bridges 
            deep learning (CNNs, RNNs, PINNs, transformers, sequence models, attention mechanisms) with CAD and CFD toolchains, and extends 
            into agentic AI—deploying LLMs and retrieval-augmented pipelines to automate model generation, validation, and iterative refinement. 
            As an MS Research Scholar at IIT Indore, I developed fault diagnosis systems for centrifugal pumps, combining fluid mechanics, signal 
            processing techniques (FFT/CWT), and customized deep neural architectures to detect and classify anomalies. I also have hands-on experience 
            in CAD modeling of gas turbine engines from my time working with GTRE-DRDO, giving me a strong practical grounding in complex mechanical 
            systems alongside data-driven intelligence.

          <p><strong>Advanced Engineering Informatics (Q1 journal, Impact Factor - 9.9)</strong> - <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2025.103181" class="btn primary">"InceptionV3 based blockage fault diagnosis of centrifugal pump"</a></p>
          <li>
            "Blockages in a centrifugal pump reduce the performance of the pump and can result in operational breakdown if not identified on time. 
            Thus, it is crucial to identify blockages in the pump to ensure its reliable working. This study presents a modified InceptionV3 Deep 
            Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify blockage faults and their severity in centrifugal pumps based on Suction pressure 
            signal, highlighting its importance in predictive analytics. Initially, the methodology involves plotting two-dimensional Continuous 
            Wavelet Transform (CWT) plots of pressure signals acquired from the pump test rig. The InceptionV3 model is employed to classify blockages
             in the pump. Validation and test accuracies of InceptionV3 are achieved as 81.71 % and 81.82 %, respectively at 2000 RPM. Afterward, the
              blockage fault diagnosis capabilities of InceptionV3 are improved by integrating Exponential Linear Units (ELUs) with Rectified Linear 
              Units (ReLUs) in the model’s architecture. It is found that validation and test accuracies increased to 95.48 % and 95.36 %, respectively, 
              in modified InceptionV3 on 35 classes (one healthy and 34 faulty conditions) at 2000RPM. The robustness of the modified InceptionV3 model 
              is highlighted by comparing test accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to the original InceptionV3 model. The proposed methodology 
              demonstrates the modified InceptionV3 model’s efficacy in classifying various blockage conditions, making it a potent tool for predictive
               maintenance in industrial settings."
